# Bike Sharing System
BoomBikes wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
The top 5 variables that are seen effecting and benefitting the Bike Rental count are as follows:
Year
Spring season
Temperature
Mist
Sun
We see that the R2 score from the train data is 0.82 and from the test data it is 0.80.
Overall, an R2 score of 0.80 on the test data is a positive sign.
It indicates that the model is performing well in terms of explaining the variation in the target variable and that it is not overfitting (i.e., it generalizes well to new data).
However, it's important to consider the domain knowledge to determine whether these R2 scores are satisfactory for our application.
